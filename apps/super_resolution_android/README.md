# Super Resolution Sample App

This sample app upscales images. The original image is displayed until the "run model" button is clicked. Once the model finishes running, an upscaled image is shown.

The app aims to showcase best practices for using **TF Lite** for model inference on Android devices.

## Requirements

- Android device with [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) (Android 14+)
- A Windows/MacOS/Linux host machine with Docker installed

## Setup

### Option A: Using the CLI (Recommended)

Install the CLI and fetch the app with the model:

```bash
pip install qai-hub-apps
qai-hub-apps fetch super_resolution_android --model xlsr --output-dir ~
cd ~/super_resolution_android
```

This downloads the app source and places the model asset in the correct location automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> To use a model you exported yourself with [AI Hub Models](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models),
> pass the exported model path to `--model` in place of a model ID. The CLI places the exported
> assets into the app automatically:
>
> ```bash
> qai-hub-apps fetch super_resolution_android --model <path/to/exported_model>
> ```

### Option B: Cloning the Repo

If you cloned the release branch, the app directory is already self-contained — but **model weights are not included**. Download a compatible model from [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models), unzip the bundle and copy the tflite model to `src/main/assets/superres.tflite` before building.

## Build

From the app directory (after either option above):

### Option A: Using Android Studio
To build APK using Android studio:
- Open this folder in Android Studio
- Run gradle sync
- Build and run the `app` target
    - Click on `Build` -> `Generate App Bundles or APKs` -> `Generate APKs`
    - Click on `Run` -> `Run 'app'`

The APKs will be at:
- `build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- `build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk`

### Option B: Using Docker

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Building on an ARM host?**
> The Android build tools (AAPT2, NDK clang) are x86_64-only binaries. To run them under emulation, register the QEMU x86_64 handler on the **host** before building (run once per boot):
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support
> sudo update-binfmts --enable qemu-x86_64
> ```

Build our Docker image with all required dependencies, including the supported Android and QAIRT SDKs.
```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILD_TYPE=build -t aiha-superres .
```
Build the APK:
```bash
docker run --name superres-container aiha-superres bash -c "source /app/scripts/android_utils.sh && cd /app && gradle assembleDebug assembleAndroidTest"

mkdir ./build

docker cp superres-container:/app/build/outputs ./build/outputs
```

#### Install & Run

Connect your Android device via USB, then:

```bash
adb install build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Launch the app from your device's app drawer.

## Supported Hardware (TF Lite Delegates)

By default, this app supports the following hardware:
* [Qualcomm Hexagon NPU -- via QNN](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk)
* [GPU -- via GPUv2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu)
* [CPU -- via XNNPack](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack/README.md)

Comments have been left in [TFLiteHelpers.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/TFLiteHelpers.java) and [AIHubDefaults.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/AIHubDefaults.java) to guide you on how to add support for additional TF Lite delegates that could target other hardware.


## AI Model Requirements

### Model Runtime Formats
- TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

### I/O Specification

| INPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Image | An RGB image | [1, Input Height**, Input Width**, 3] | float32 or uint8 (zero point of 0, scale of 1 / 255)

| OUTPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Image | An Upscaled RGB Image | [ 1, Output Height**, Output Width**, 3 ] | float32 or uint8 (zero point of 0, scale of 1 / 255)

** Any width / height is supported. The input image will be resized to fit the network.

## Compatible [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models)

The below is a non-exhaustive list of [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models) that should be compatible.

**Not every model has been individually tested with this app**. Please file an issue or reach out on [Slack](http://aihub.qualcomm.com/community/slack) if you find a model in this list with app compatibility issues.

Please download the TFLite asset. Variants `float` and `w8a8` are both supported by the app.

- [ESRGAN](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/esrgan)
- [QuickSRNetLarge](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetlarge)
- [QuickSRNetMedium](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetmedium)
- [QuickSRNetSmall](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/quicksrnetsmall)
- [Real-ESRGAN-General-x4v3](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/real_esrgan_general_x4v3)
- [Real-ESRGAN-x4plus](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/real_esrgan_x4plus)
- [SESR-M5](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/sesr_m5)
- [XLSR](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models/xlsr)

A good model to start with is QuickSRNetSmall, which strikes a good
balance between speed and numerical performance.

## Replicating an AI Hub Profile / Inference Job

Each AI Hub profile or inference job, once completed, will contain a `Runtime Configuration` section.

Modify [TFLiteHelpers.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/TFLiteHelpers.java) according to the runtime configuration applied to the job. **Comment stubs are included** to help guide you (search for `TO REPLICATE AN AI HUB JOB...`)

Note that if your job uses delegates other than QNN NPU, GPUv2, and TFLite, then you will also need to add support for those delegates to the app.
