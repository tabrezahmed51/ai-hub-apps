# Image Classification Sample App

This sample app classifies images. The top 3 predicted Imagenet classes are displayed.

The app aims to showcase best practices for using **TF Lite** for model inference on Android devices.

## Requirements

- Android device with [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) (Android 14+)
- A Windows/MacOS/Linux host machine with Docker installed

## Setup

### Option A: Using the CLI (Recommended)

Install the CLI and fetch the app with the model:

```bash
pip install qai-hub-apps
qai-hub-apps fetch image_classification_android --model convnext_tiny --output-dir ~
cd ~/image_classification_android
```

This downloads the app source and places the model asset in the correct location automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> To use a model you exported yourself with [AI Hub Models](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models),
> pass the exported model path to `--model` in place of a model ID. The CLI places the exported
> assets into the app automatically:
>
> ```bash
> qai-hub-apps fetch image_classification_android --model <path/to/exported_model>
> ```

### Option B: Cloning the Repo

If you cloned the release branch, the app directory is already self-contained — but **model weights are not included**. Download a compatible model from [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models), unzip the bundle and copy the tflite model to `src/main/assets/classifier.tflite` before building.

## Build

From the app directory (after either option above):

### Option A: Using Android Studio
To build APK using Android studio:
- Open this folder in Android Studio
- Run gradle sync
- Build and run the `app` target
    - Click on `Build` -> `Generate App Bundles or APKs` -> `Generate APKs`
    - Click on `Run` -> `Run 'app'`

The APKs will be at:
- `build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- `build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk`

### Option B: Using Docker

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Building on an ARM host?**
> The Android build tools (AAPT2, NDK clang) are x86_64-only binaries. To run them under emulation, register the QEMU x86_64 handler on the **host** before building (run once per boot):
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support
> sudo update-binfmts --enable qemu-x86_64
> ```

Build our Docker image with all required dependencies, including the supported Android and QAIRT SDKs.
```bash
docker build --build-arg BUILD_TYPE=build -t aiha-classification .
```
Build the APK:
```bash
docker run --name classification-container aiha-classification bash -c "source /app/scripts/android_utils.sh && cd /app && gradle assembleDebug assembleAndroidTest"

mkdir ./build

docker cp classification-container:/app/build/outputs ./build/outputs
```

#### Install & Run

Connect your Android device via USB, then:

```bash
adb install build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Launch the app from your device's app drawer.

## Supported Hardware (TF Lite Delegates)

By default, this app supports the following hardware:
* [Qualcomm Hexagon NPU -- via QNN](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk)
* [GPU -- via GPUv2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu)
* [CPU -- via XNNPack](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack/README.md)

Comments have been left in [TFLiteHelpers.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/TFLiteHelpers.java) and [AIHubDefaults.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/AIHubDefaults.java) to guide you on how to add support for additional TF Lite delegates that could target other hardware.


## AI Model Requirements

### Model Runtime Formats
- TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)

### I/O Specification

| INPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Image | An RGB image | [1, Height, Width, 3] | float32 or uint8 (zero point of 0, scale of 1 / 255)

| OUTPUT | Description | Shape | Data Type
| -- | -- | -- | --
| Classes | **Imagenet** Classes | [ 1, 1000 ] | float32, uint8, or int8 (any quantization params)


## Compatible [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models)

The below is a non-exhaustive list of [AI Hub Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/mobile/models) that should be compatible.

**Not every model has been individually tested with this app**. Please file an issue or reach out on [Slack](http://aihub.qualcomm.com/community/slack) if you find a model in this list with app compatibility issues.

Please download the TFLite asset or use the CLI. Variants `float` is tested and supported by the app.

## Replicating an AI Hub Profile / Inference Job

Each AI Hub profile or inference job, once completed, will contain a `Runtime Configuration` section.

Modify [TFLiteHelpers.java](src/main/java/com/quicinc/tflite/TFLiteHelpers.java) according to the runtime configuration applied to the job. **Comment stubs are included** to help guide you (search for `TO REPLICATE AN AI HUB JOB...`)

Note that if your job uses delegates other than QNN NPU, GPUv2, and TFLite, then you will also need to add support for those delegates to the app.
