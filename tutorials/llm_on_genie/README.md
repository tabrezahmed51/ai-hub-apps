# LLM On-Device Deployment

In this tutorial, we will run large language models (LLMs) on-device on
Snapdragon® platforms such as:

- Android: Snapdragon® 8 Elite Gen 5, Snapdragon® 8 Elite (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Series)
- Windows: Snapdragon® X2 Elite, Snapdragon® X Elite (e.g. Snapdragon® based Microsoft Surface Pro)
- Linux: Dragonwing® Platforms (e.g. Dragonwing® QCM8550, Dragonwing® IQ-9075)

We use [Qwen3-4B](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_4b) as the running
example. In case of any questions, please feel free to post them on the
[Qualcomm AI Hub Slack channel](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/community/slack).

## Overview

There are three steps to run
[Qwen3-4B](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_4b):

- **Step 1:** Install the [QAIRT SDK](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/catalog/item/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_Community) on the target device.
- **Step 2:** Prepare a Genie bundle for the target device. You have two options:
  - **Option A:** Download ready-made assets from [Qualcomm AI Hub
    Models](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models) (available for some models,
    including Qwen3-4B).
  - **Option B:** Export the model yourself with
    [qai-hub-models](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models/tree/main/src/qai_hub_models/models)
    (required for models with restricted weights such as Llama). See
    [export.md](export.md) for the full export walkthrough.
- **Step 3:** Run the LLM on the target device with an example prompt.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
Target device requirements:

- Hexagon architecture v73 or above (please see [Devices](https://app.aihub.qualcomm.com/devices/) list).
- 16GB memory or more for 7B+ or 4096 context length models.
- 12GB memory or more for 3B+ models (and you may need to adjust down context length).

Software requirements:

- Android 15+, Windows 11
- [QAIRT SDK](https://qpm.qualcomm.com/#/main/tools/details/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK) v2.29.0+ (see [QNN SDK](https://qpm.qualcomm.com/#/main/tools/details/qualcomm_ai_engine_direct) for versions prior to 2.32; Automotive devices require Auto QAIRT SDK instead of the standard QAIRT SDK, see below for more details)
- [qai-hub-models](https://pypi.org/project/qai-hub-models/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each [model card](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_4b)
> specifically lists compatible devices and minimum QAIRT SDK versions.
> Ensure device and software requirements are met before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install QAIRT (on the target device)

We recommend the use of the same version of QAIRT SDK on-target that Qualcomm AI
used to compile the assets.  The QAIRT version is displayed on model cards (for
pre-compiled models) in the [Qualcomm AI Hub model
cards](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models) or by clicking on the job links
produced by the export scripts of the [Qualcomm AI Hub models python
package](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models).

Download the specific version of the QAIRT SDK from the [Qualcomm Software
Center](https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/catalog/item/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_Community)
and copy it to the target device. If the target has internet connectivity, you
can also download it directly using `wget` with the URL shown in the Software
Center. Alternately, download [QAIRT SDK](https://qpm.qualcomm.com/#/main/tools/details/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_SDK) and install it via [QPM.](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-88500-5/install_qualcomm_package_manager_qpm.html)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Automotive devices require access to the Auto specific QAIRT SDK which can be obtained by contacting your Qualcomm Account Manager, for those looking to purchase Auto SoCs and gain access to Auto SDK, please reach out on our [Qualcomm AI Hub Slack Community](http://aihub.qualcomm.com/community/slack) for next steps. Additional steps required to set up auto devices can be found in [Android (Automotive)](https://github.com/qcom-ai-hub/ai-hub-apps-internal/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie#android-automotive)


Once downloaded, please set the following environment variables:

### Android (bash)

Please make sure the architecture matches that of the device. The [mapping of
architecture to device](https://app.aihub.qualcomm.com/devices) can help.

```bash
export QAIRT_HOME= ## Location of downloaded QAIRT SDK on target device
export PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/bin/aarch64-android/:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/lib/aarch64-android:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Please make sure the architecture matches that of the device
# (v73 for 8 Elite, v81 for 8 Elite Gen 5)
export ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/lib/hexagon-v73/unsigned
```

### Windows (Powershell)

Note that in Windows Powershell, the binaries and libraries are loaded from the
`$env:Path` variable.

```powershell
$env:QAIRT_HOME = ## Location of downloaded QAIRT SDK
$env:Path = "$env:QAIRT_HOME\bin\aarch64-windows-msvc;" + $env:Path
$env:Path = "$env:QAIRT_HOME\lib\aarch64-windows-msvc;" + $env:Path

# Please make sure the architecture matches that of the device
# (v73 for X Elite, v81 for X2 Elite)
$env:ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH = "$env:QAIRT_HOME\lib\hexagon-v73\unsigned"
```

### Linux - Ubuntu (bash)

This will work on Ubuntu 22.04+. Please adjust `aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2` if
you are on an older version.

```bash
# Export environment variables
export QAIRT_HOME= ## Location of downloaded QAIRT SDK on target device
export PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/bin/aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/lib/aarch64-oe-linux-gcc11.2:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Please make sure the architecture matches that of the device (e.g. v73, v75, v81)
export ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH=${QAIRT_HOME}/lib/hexagon-v73/unsigned
```

These changes can be made permanent by adding the above lines to the `~/.bashrc` file on
Android/Linux and `$PROFILE` on Windows PowerShell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please make sure the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` variable points to the libraries
> for the appropriate architecture. The [mapping of device to architecture](https://app.aihub.qualcomm.com/devices)
> can provide additional details.

### Android (Automotive)

```bash
export AUTO_QAIRT_HOME= ## Location of downloaded Auto QAIRT SDK on target device
export PATH=${AUTO_QAIRT_HOME}/bin/aarch64-android/:${PATH}

# Please make sure the architecture matches that of the device (e.g. v73, v75, v81)
export VENDOR_LIB=${AUTO_QAIRT_HOME}/lib/hexagon-v75/unsigned

export ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH="/vendor/lib/rfsa/adsp;$VENDOR_LIB;"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${AUTO_QAIRT_HOME}/lib/aarch64-android:/vendor/lib64/
```

For auto devices, once the SDK is installed, users need to copy additional library files (`libc++.so.1` and `libc++abi.so.1`) from QNX to Linux/Android Guest Virtual Machine (LA GVM) in order to run `genie-t2t`.

* A standard automotive device may have more than one VM running - a primary VM (QNX) and guest VMs through a hypervisor (Android or Linux or both). You will be running the application in LA GVM while the required files are present in QNX.
* In order to transfer the required library files, you need to FTP to QNX and copy the library files to a HOST system and then push it to the LA GVM (preferrably through ADB). The library files will be available in `/dsplib/image/dsp/cdsp0/` or `/mnt/etc/images/cdsp0/` under your QNX filesystem.
* Copy the `libc++.so.1` and `libc++abi.so.1` files from this directory to your HOST system and connect to LA GVM. Push these files to `$VENDOR_LIB` in LA GVM from your HOST system.

> [!NOTE]
> On QDC automotive devices, `libc++.so.1` and `libc++abi.so.1` are typically already present in the LA GVM at `/data/local/tmp/qxa.qa_adsplib/`. You can use the following command to copy the files:
> ```
> cp /data/local/tmp/qxa.qa_adsplib/libc++.so.1 $VENDOR_LIB
> cp /data/local/tmp/qxa.qa_adsplib/libc++abi.so.1 $VENDOR_LIB

## Step 2: Prepare a Genie bundle (on the host machine)

You have two options for producing the `genie_bundle` folder that will be
deployed to the device.

### Option A: Download ready-made assets

Some models have pre-compiled assets available for download, including our
running example, [Qwen3-4B](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_4b). The AI
Hub model card does not currently expose a direct download button. Instead,
follow the Hugging Face link from the model card: the Hugging Face README
contains a table with download links to the assets for each supported device.
For Qwen3-4B specifically, that page is
[huggingface.co/qualcomm/Qwen3-4B](https://huggingface.co/qualcomm/Qwen3-4B).

Pick the row matching your target device, unzip the download, and use the
resulting folder as `genie_bundle`. Make sure the QAIRT SDK version installed
on the device matches the one listed alongside the assets.

If the downloaded assets do not include a tokenizer or Genie configuration
file, see [Prepare Genie bundle manually](manual_bundle.md).

### Option B: Export the model yourself

Some models (notably the Llama family, which requires gated Hugging Face
access) are not distributed as pre-compiled assets and must be exported from
source with
[qai-hub-models](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models/tree/main/src/qai_hub_models/).

See [export.md](export.md) for the full export walkthrough.

## Step 3: Run the LLM on-device

You have four options to run the LLM on device:

- Option 1: Use the `genie-t2t-run` CLI command
- Option 2: Use the `genie-app` CLI command with a model-provided script (if available)
- Option 3: Use the [CLI Windows ChatApp](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/apps/chatapp_windows_cpp)
- Option 4: Use the [Android ChatApp](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/apps/chatapp_android)

### *Option 1*: Run Genie via `genie-t2t-run`

The QAIRT SDK (Android, Windows, and Linux) provides an executable called
`genie-t2t-run` to run bundle-formatted LLM models exported via Qualcomm AI Hub.

Many system prompts contain the line feed character (`\n`, ascii 0x0a) as part
of the correct prompt format. We have to pay extra attention to how we pass this
into the LLM so that it is not passed in as `\` and `n` as two separate
characters. This is platform-specific, so more on this in the sections below.

See the section on [prompt formats for various models](#prompt-formats).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On all platforms, we recommend copy-pasting the prompts into a separate file
> (e.g., `prompt.txt`) and passing that prompt into `genie-t2t-run` with
> `--prompt_file prompt.txt`. If you take this approach, please make sure you
> replace the `\n` characters with real newlines.

#### Windows on Snapdragon® X

In PowerShell, this can be run using the following command

```bash
genie-t2t-run.exe -c genie_config.json -p "<|im_start|>system`nYou are a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>`n<|im_start|>user`nWhat is France's capital?<|im_end|>`n<|im_start|>assistant`n"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This prompt format is specific to Qwen3. Use `` `n `` (instead of `\n`) to
> pass a real line feed in Windows PowerShell.

For non‑Latin languages (e.g., Chinese, Arabic), first [configure Windows to use UTF‑8](windows/utf8.md).

#### Android

Copy `genie_bundle` from the host to the device using ADB, then open an
interactive shell:

```bash
adb push genie_bundle /data/local/tmp
adb shell
```

Once copied to the device, run the following:

```bash
genie-t2t-run -c genie_config.json -p "<|im_start|>system"$'\n'$"You are a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>"$'\n'$"<|im_start|>user"$'\n'$"What is France's capital?<|im_end|>"$'\n'$"<|im_start|>assistant"$'\n'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To pass real line feeds into Genie in Bash, use `$'\n'$` instead of `"\n"`.
> We generally recommend using a prompt file with real newlines.

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

This can be run using the following command:

```bash
genie-t2t-run -c genie_config.json -p "<|im_start|>system"$'\n'$"You are a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>"$'\n'$"<|im_start|>user"$'\n'$"What is France's capital?<|im_end|>"$'\n'$"<|im_start|>assistant"$'\n'
```

#### Sample output

```text
Using libGenie.so version 1.1.0

[WARN]  "Unable to initialize logging in backend extensions."
[INFO]  "Using create From Binary List Async"
[INFO]  "Allocated total size = 323453440 across 10 buffers"
[PROMPT]: <|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is France's capital?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n

[BEGIN]: <think>
Okay, the user is asking about the capital of France. I need to provide an accurate answer. First, I should recall what I know about French capital. The capital of France is Paris. But wait, I should make sure I'm not making a mistake. Sometimes, people might confuse the capital with another city, but no, Paris is definitely the capital. Let me double-check. Yes, Paris is the capital city of France. So the answer is Paris. I should present this clearly and confirm that there's no confusion with other cities like Lyon or Marseille, but no, Paris is the correct answer. I need to make sure the answer is correct and not confused with other cities. Also, maybe mention that it's the capital, and maybe add a bit about its significance, but the main point is to state that the capital is Paris.
</think>

The capital of France is **Paris**. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country and is widely recognized as the capital. Paris is known for its rich history, iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum, and its role as a global hub for art, fashion, and gastronomy.[END]

Performance KPIs (token rate, time-to-first-token, etc.) can be obtained by
passing `--profile path_to_txt_file.txt` to `genie-t2t-run`.

### Option 2: Run Genie via `genie-app` with a model-provided script

If the model's Genie bundle ships with a `genie-app-script.txt` file, you can
run the bundle end-to-end using the `genie-app` executable from the QAIRT SDK:

```bash
genie-app -s genie-app-script.txt
```

The script encodes the correct prompt format and turn structure, so you do not
need to assemble the prompt yourself. For vision-language models (VLMs), the
script also exercises image input, making this the recommended quick check
that the model pipeline (text + image) is working on device.

### Option 3: Sample C++ Chat App Powered by Genie SDK

We provide a sample C++ app to show how to build an application using the Genie
SDK. See the [CLI Windows
ChatApp](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/apps/chatapp_windows_cpp)
for more details.

### Option 4: Sample Android Chat App Powered by Genie SDK

We provide a sample Android app (Java and C++) to show how to build an
application using the Genie SDK for mobile. See [Android
ChatApp](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/apps/chatapp_android) for
more details.

## Additional Assistance

In this section, we cover a few topics in more detail for those new to
some of these concepts.

### Setting up a Python environment with Qualcomm AI Hub Models

Following standard best practices, we recommend creating a virtual environment
specifically for exporting AI Hub models. The following steps can be performed
on Windows, Linux, or macOS. On Windows, you can either install x86-64 Python
(since package support is limited on native ARM64 Python) or use Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

#### Create Virtual Environment

Create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for `qai-hub-models` with Python 3.10.
You can also use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

For clarity, we recommend creating a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv llm_on_genie_venv
```

#### Install `qai-hub-models`

In a shell session, install `qai-hub-models` in the virtual environment:

```bash
source llm_on_genie_venv/bin/activate
pip install -U "qai-hub-models[llama-v3.2-3b-instruct]"
```

Replace `llama-v3.2-3b-instruct` with the desired Llama model from [AI Hub
Models](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-models/tree/main/src/qai_hub_models/models).
Note to replace `_` with `-` (e.g., `llama_v3.2_3b_instruct` -> `llama-v3.2-3b-instruct`).


### Prompt Formats

Different LLMs have different prompt formats. To get sensible output, it is
important to use the correct prompt format for each model. These can also be
found on the Hugging Face repository for each model. A few examples are below.

| Model name                                                                                               | Sample Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
